"Update the code with [see new architect locks below], but apply an ARCHITECT LOCK: Do

not change the UI layout, the header titles , the color

palette, or the existing logic patterns. Only insert the requested changes

into the existing structure. Make sure that under: 1. building details: there are six items, 2: pre-job checklist: there are five items,3. Control equipment: there are seven items: 4: Device inventory: 28 Items,5: Battery Health: there are 7 items. 6: emergency lights: there are five items. Features include: when changing or editing items, a confirmation to save or cancel. Under number one building details, inspector is the person inspecting and will be blank to start. When toggling to local only under building details the Monitoring phone number disappears, when toggling into monitored the phone number reappears and is editable with app confirmations not browser. When adding a new device row: if left blank, then it doesn't enter a new device, there must be a name for it to be saved. When I get new device that has a device drop-down menu to pick from. Emergency lights are also able to be added just like devices in the same way. I am also able to save multiple photos and videos as well as notes to each of the checklists in any of the categories.I am able to create a report and save it to my device or upload it to the cloud to a file or save to file. All items in the categories are editable: The device #, Device name, Notes and media, also devices can be deleted with app prompt and not the browser Prompt. Data is saved so if the phone turns off its saved. when generating & cloud Sync is pressed, it generates a full pdf report of the entire building inspection from categories 1-7. Then it also generates a file that i can open up and change anything if necessary. The deficiencies pull from all category lists: 2,3,4,5,6.
